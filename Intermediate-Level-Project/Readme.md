Step-by-Step Installation:

1. Install Python (if you haven't already):
Go to the Python download page: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Select the correct version (e.g., Python 3.9) and operating system (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux)
Follow the installation instructions for your operating system

2. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:
On Windows: Press Win + R to open the Run dialog, type cmd, and press Enter.
On macOS/Linux: Open the Terminal app.

3. Install Scapy using pip:
Type the following command and press Enter:
pip install scapy
This may take a few seconds to complete. You'll see a progress bar and some output indicating the installation progress.

4. Verify the installation:
Type the following command and press Enter:
python
python -c "import scapy; print(scapy.2.5.0)"
If everything is installed correctly, you should see the version number of Scapy printed.

5. Install additional dependencies (optional):
Scapy requires some additional dependencies to work properly. You can install them using the following command:
pip install scapy[complete]
This will install all the required dependencies, including WinPcap (for Windows) or libpcap (for macOS/Linux).

6. Create a new Python file:
Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad, TextEdit, Sublime Text) and create a new file.
Save the file with a .py extension (e.g., packet_sniffer.py).

7. Run the code:
Open a Terminal or Command Prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file.
Type the following command and press Enter:

python packet_sniffer.py
The script will start running, and you'll see the packet details
