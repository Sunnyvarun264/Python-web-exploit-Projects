Project Title: Network Packet Sniffer

Project Description:
The goal of this project is to design and implement a network packet sniffer that can capture and analyze network packets on a target system.
The sniffer should be able to capture packets from a specific network interface, extract relevant information from the packets, and store the 
data in a local file for later analysis.

Deliverables:
A Python script that implements the network packet sniffer
A sample output file containing captured packets
A report detailing the design and implementation of the sniffer

Learning Outcomes:
Understand how to capture and analyze network packets in Python
Learn how to extract relevant information from packets
Develop skills in designing and implementing a network packet sniffer
Improve problem-solving skills through debugging and troubleshooting
