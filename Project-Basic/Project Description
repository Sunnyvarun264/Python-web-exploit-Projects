Project Title: Keystroke Logger

Project Description:
The goal of this project is to design and implement a keystroke logger that can capture and store keystrokes on a target system.
The logger should be able to record all keyboard input, including alphanumeric characters, special characters, and keyboard shortcuts
The captured keystrokes should be stored in a local file for later analysis.

Deliverables:
A Python script that implements the keystroke logger
A sample output file containing captured keystrokes
A report detailing the design and implementation of the logger

Learning Outcomes:
Understand how to handle keyboard input in Python
Learn how to store and analyze data in a file
Develop skills in designing and implementing a keystroke logger
Improve problem-solving skills through debugging and troubleshooting
