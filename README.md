Keystroke Logger and Network Packet Sniffer
Overview
This repository contains two projects: 
a keystroke logger and a network packet sniffer. Both projects were completed as part of a challenge to showcase my skills to Albus Security.
## Keystroke logger

The keystroke logger captures and stores keystrokes on a target system. It is implemented in Python and uses the pynput library to capture keyboard input.
## Packet sniffer

The network packet sniffer captures and analyzes network packets on a target system. It is implemented in Python and uses the scapy library to capture and analyze packets.
